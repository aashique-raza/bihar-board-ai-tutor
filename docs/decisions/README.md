# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

## What this is

One file per significant architectural decision. Each records **what** was
decided, **why**, **what was rejected**, and **what would make us revisit it**.

## Why this exists

An AI agent has no memory between sessions. It reads code, not reasoning. A
reviewer who does not know *why* a decision was made will treat it as a mistake
— including decisions it made itself in an earlier session.

That is exactly what happened repeatedly on this project: a decision would be
made together, implemented, and then "discovered as a problem" weeks later.

**These files are the project's memory.** They live in the repo, so they survive.

## The rule (also in `AUDIT_RULES.md`, Rule 7)

If a review finding contradicts an ADR, it must say so explicitly:

> "This contradicts ADR-00X. The new evidence is: ___"

Silently re-litigating a settled decision is not allowed.

## Writing a new ADR

Copy `TEMPLATE.md`. Number sequentially. Never edit a decision after it is
accepted — supersede it with a new ADR and mark the old one `Superseded by ADR-0XX`.
