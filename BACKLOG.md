Source: full Ask-pipeline audit, 2026-08-28. That audit produced 25 findings.
8 were BROKEN and moved to `STAGE1_DONE.md`. The rest are below, honestly
re-classified — most were opinions presented as problems.

## 🟡 RISK — works today, fails at a named threshold

### R1. Answer truncation destroys the whole response
**Threshold:** any answer longer than `maxTokens: 1500`
**Where:** `ask/intentRouter.js` streaming block

Raw JSON is streamed to the browser and parsed only at the end. If the model
hits the token cap, the JSON is cut mid-string, `findJsonEnd()` returns `-1`,
and the student — who just watched a complete answer stream in — gets
"Thodi technical dikkat aayi."

**Fix direction:** check `finish_reason === 'length'` and salvage the partial
`sections[0].content` instead of discarding everything.
**Note:** Stage 2's structured output removes most of this class.

---

### R2. Redis free tier ceiling
**Threshold:** ~2,000 turns/day (roughly 5 Redis ops per turn on ~10k/day free tier)
**Impact:** rate limiting and caching degrade or fail
**Fix direction:** paid Upstash tier before ~500 daily users

---

### R3. LLM cost at scale
**Threshold:** measured ~$0.00125/turn → ~$2,800/month at 5,000 DAU, ~$28,000/month at 50,000 DAU
**Fix direction:** O1 (answer cache) is the largest lever, then O2, then O3.
This does not block launch, but it must shape Stage 2 and 3 design.

---

### R4. MongoDB Atlas tier
**Threshold:** vector search on a shared/free tier degrades well before 50k users
**Fix direction:** M10+ when daily actives cross ~1,000

---

### R5. NEXT_STEP chunk fetch is unbounded
**Threshold:** any topic with many linked chunks
**Where:** `rag/retriever.js:105` — no `.limit()`, no ordering
**Impact:** floods the prompt, dilutes the answer, pushes toward R1
**Fix direction:** `.limit(6)` + sort by `chunk_index`
*(Partially addressed by Stage 1 bug BUG-5, which adds the projection and index.)*

## ⚪ OPINION — design improvements, not bugs

These are things a reviewer would design differently. **None of them is a defect.**
None may be presented as urgent or as a problem during an active stage.

### O1. Answer cache (highest value item in this file)
Students repeat the same questions constantly. "Photosynthesis kya hai" may be
asked thousands of times and is recomputed from scratch every time.
A semantic answer cache could serve an estimated 40–60% of traffic at near-zero cost.
**Stage 2.**

### O2. Structured output / JSON schema
`chatModel.js` creates `ChatOpenAI` with no `response_format`. All JSON is
scraped from free text by `utils/jsonParser.js`. Three parse-error fallback
branches exist because this fails in practice.
Switching to `.withStructuredOutput(schema, { strict: true })` would make parse
errors structurally impossible and allow deleting `jsonParser.js` plus all three
fallbacks. It also removes the cause behind Stage 1 bugs BUG-1 and BUG-2 — satisfying
`AUDIT_RULES.md` Rule 4.

**Partially pulled into Stage 1 (2026-08-28, ADR-011):** the **decider chain**
slice is being converted now, because BUG-1/BUG-2 have no Rule 4-compliant fix
without it. **Remaining Stage 2 scope:** the tutor / intentRouter chains
(`step6`, `intentRouter.js`, the 10 intent prompts) — these stream, which makes
structured output materially harder, and `utils/jsonParser.js` stays until they
are converted too.
**Stage 2 — highest priority in this list.**

### O3. Hybrid search (BM25 + vector + RRF)
Retrieval is vector-only. `reranker.js` hand-simulates a keyword leg using 14
tuned constants, interacting with 4 more thresholds in `retriever.js`. Atlas
already provides `$search` (BM25) next to `$vectorSearch`; Reciprocal Rank
Fusion would replace most of `reranker.js` with a zero-tuning-constant algorithm.
**Stage 2.**

### O4. Keyword match should be a boost, not a gate
`step5.retrieveContent.js:24` sets `requireTermMatchForLatinQuery: true`, which
hard-rejects any chunk with zero keyword overlap regardless of vector score.
Since the search query is a paraphrase the decider invented, vocabulary mismatch
can produce zero chunks and a false "this topic is in another chapter" message.
**Stage 2 — pairs with O3.**

### O5. Remove the 12 defensive layers
SafetyNet, DriftCap, Guard 1–4, Title Rescue, Intent Firewall, Out-of-Focus
Fallback, 3 parse-error fallbacks. Many become unnecessary once O2 and Stage 1
bug BUG-4 land.
**Stage 2.**

### O6. Deterministic pre-router
Every "hi", "ok", "thanks", "bye" currently costs a full decider LLM call with a
~2,000-token prompt. A small exact-match/regex router for the top ~30 phrases
would skip the LLM on roughly 30–40% of turns and be more reliable than the
model for those exact cases.
**Stage 3.**

### O7. Prompt caching
System prompts (`corePersona` + per-intent rules) are static and therefore
cacheable. Structuring them as a stable prefix would cut input cost significantly.
**Stage 3.**

### O8. Trim the science glossary per turn
The full glossary (~1,200 tokens) is injected into every study prompt. Only the
terms actually present in the retrieved chunks are needed — typically 5–10.
**Stage 3.**

### O9. Decider is blind to Focus Mode
`ask/step4.decideRetrieval.js:157` destructures only `{ deciderHistory, language }`.
Its own JSDoc claims it uses `focusChapterPrompt` and `currentStudyContext`, but
neither is passed. The classifier does not know which chapter the student is in.
**Stage 2.**

### O10. Remove the legacy step6 path
`ask/step6.generateResponse.js` still contains the full pre-router implementation
behind `USE_INTENT_ROUTER`. It uses a different prompt and does not stream.
Once STAGE1 I2 (env verification) confirms the router is live everywhere, delete it.
**Stage 2.**

### O11. Internal `decision` object is returned to the client
`ask/step7.saveAndRespond.js` ships intent, reason, and searchQuery to the browser.
**Stage 3.**

### O12. `EXAM_INFO` gets a forced "Aage badhein" chip
`ask/step7.saveAndRespond.js:125`. A student asking about marks receives an
advance-the-chapter button.
**Stage 3.**

### O13. Unknown-intent recursion drops streaming and abort
`ask/intentRouter.js` re-calls `routeToIntentHandler` without `streamCallbacks`
or `abortSignal`.
**Stage 2.**

### O14. `answerLanguage: 'english'` is a dead branch
`utils/languageDetector.js` can only ever return `'hindi'` or `'hinglish'`.
The comment justifying this states the vector store is "indexed in Hinglish",
which is factually wrong — `data/` is English, and `rag/retriever.js` says so.
The decision may still be correct; the stated reason is not.
**Stage 3 — fix the comment now, revisit the behaviour later.**

### O15. Documentation sprawl
16 markdown plan files in the repo root. Several are point-in-time snapshots
that contradict current code. `PROJECT_STATE.md` now supersedes most of them.
**Stage 2 — archive, don't delete.**

## Feature ideas (owner's stated goals, not yet scoped)

| Idea | Notes |
|---|---|
| Subjective / long-answer practice | PYQ bank on `quiz-phase0.5-bulk` already has the raw material |
| Previous-year paper mode | 2016–2026 papers exist on that stranded branch |
| Weakness / strength analytics | `studyEvent.model.js` already logs events — the data foundation exists |
| Other subjects (Maths first) | See ADR-007 — deliberately deferred until Science is proven |
| Spaced repetition / revision | Not started |
